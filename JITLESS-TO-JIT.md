# Switch From JIT-Less to JIT

When you disable JIT-less and try to use JIT instead, the launcher will most likely error out. Here's how to properly switch from JIT-less to JIT:

- Go to the **Geode Launcher settings**
- Scroll all the way down until you see **"iOS Launcher"**
- **Hold the iOS Launcher text** until you get a popup to **enable Developer Mode**.
- Press **"Yes"** on the popup

- Scroll down until you see the **Developer** section
- Click **"Restore Binary"**
- (Optionally) **Disable Developer Mode** as you no longer need it
- Disable **JIT-less Mode**
- Launch Geode with your **preferred JIT enabler**.
