# Getting Started on Installing Geode
This page **will help you install Geode on your iDevice**. This page exists because unfortunately, it's more difficult to install Geode on iOS compared to other platforms due to the limitations of Apple.

> [!WARNING]
> For all installation guides, excluding the Developer Certificate JIT-less install guide, it is **required** to have a computer with Administrator access, as this guide will require installing software on your computer to sideload Geode, and/or sideloading TrollStore. If you can't get TrollStore, you will also need a PC to obtain a pairing file for **JIT** or **SideStore**. \
> \
> Geode **only works from iOS 14 to the latest iOS version** (iOS 26 Developer Beta). Geode will not work on iOS versions below 14. \
> \
> Unless you **have an Apple Developer Subscription**, Geode **will** use one of your 3 app slots and **one** of your 10 App IDs. \
> \
> TrollStore and the jailbreak method will only work on versions listed [here](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/), and SideStore method will work on iOS 17.4 and above.

To get started, choose an installation guide for your iOS version.

[iOS 16.7 RC, iOS 17.0 and Below (TrollStore / Jailbreak)](/OLD-IOS-INSTALL.md)

[iOS 17.4+ (SideStore)](/MODERN-IOS-INSTALL.md)

[iOS 26 (JIT-Less)](/JITLESS-INSTALL-GUIDE.md)

[LiveContainer](/LIVECONTAINER-INSTALL-GUIDE.md)

> [!TIP]
> If you **don't know which iOS version you're on**, follow [this page from Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109065) to check your iOS version.\
> \
> If you **don't have a PC**, **are on iOS 17.4 or later (especially iOS 26)**, and are **willing to spend money on an Apple developer certificate**, you can follow the [JIT-less](/JITLESS-INSTALL-GUIDE.md) guide to use Geode **without a PC**. If you **have a PC**, as long as you're **not on iOS 26**, you can use the [SideStore](/MODERN-IOS-INSTALL.md) method. If you **are on iOS 26 and have a PC**, follow the [SideStore](/MODERN-IOS-INSTALL.md) guide but **instead of setting up StikDebug**, follow the [JIT-less](/JITLESS-INSTALL-GUIDE.md) guide and **import the SideStore certificate** (the steps to import the certificate are **available in the JIT-less guide**) and make sure that you have **the versions of SideStore listed in the JIT-less guide**.
