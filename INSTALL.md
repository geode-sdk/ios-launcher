# Getting Started on Installing Geode
This page **will help you install Geode on your iDevice**. Unlike other platforms, installing Geode on iOS is not straightforward due to how locked down the operating system is, so this guide exists for you to find the best methods to install Geode on your iDevice.
> [!WARNING]
> Geode **only works from iOS 14 to the latest iOS version**. Geode will not work on iOS versions below iOS 14.

> [!TIP]
> If you **don't know the iOS version of your iDevice**, follow [this page from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109065) to check your iOS version.
