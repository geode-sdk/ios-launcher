# Getting Started on Installing Geode
Hello! This page **will help you install Geode on your iDevice**. This page exists because unfortunately, it's more difficult to install Geode on iOS compared to other platforms due to the limitations of Apple.

> [!WARNING]
> Geode **only works from iOS 14 to the latest iOS version**. Geode will not work on iOS versions below 14.

> [!TIP]
> If you **don't know which iOS version you're on**, follow [this page from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109065) to check your iOS version.

> [!WARNING]
> TrollStore and the jailbreak method will only work on versions listed [here](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/), and SideStore method will work on iOS 17.4 and above.

> [!WARNING]
> Installing TrollStore on iOS 17.0 or installing SideStore **will require the usage of a computer**.

To get started, choose an installation guide for your iOS version.
