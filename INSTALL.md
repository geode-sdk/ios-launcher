# Getting Started on Installing Geode
This page **will help you install Geode on your iDevice**. This page exists because unfortunately, it's more difficult to install Geode on iOS compared to other platforms due to the limitations of Apple.

> [!WARNING]
> For all installation guides, excluding the JIT-less install guides, it is **required** to have a computer with Administrator access, as this guide will require installing software on your computer to sideload Geode, and/or sideloading TrollStore. If you can't get TrollStore, you will also need a PC to obtain a pairing file for **JIT**.

> [!WARNING]
> Geode **only works from iOS 14 to the latest iOS version**. Geode will not work on iOS versions below 14.

> [!WARNING]
> TrollStore and the jailbreak method will only work on versions listed [here](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/), and SideStore method will work on iOS 17.4 and above.

To get started, choose an installation guide for your iOS version.

> [!TIP]
> If you **don't know which iOS version you're on**, follow [this page from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109065) to check your iOS version.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't have a PC, and are above iOS 17.4+, and you're willing to spend money, follow the [JIT-less guide](/JITLESS-INSTALL-GUIDE.md).
