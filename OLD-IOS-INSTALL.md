# Installation Guide (TrollStore / Jailbreak)

This guide is for devices that are compatible with TrollStore (and optionally a jailbreak)

## Prerequisites
- PC (Windows, Linux) or Mac OS (only for iOS 17.0)
- USB Cable to connect your device (Lightning / USB C) (only for iOS 17.0) 
- TrollStore (or **if you're on an iOS version where TrollStore is not supported** but you're able to jailbreak, **[TrollStore Lite](https://havoc.app/package/trollstorelite))**
- A jailbreak like Dopamine (optional, only if you want to use the jailbreak tweak)
- Full version of Geometry Dash installed
- IPA / TIPA file of Geode launcher from [Releases](https://github.com/geode-sdk/ios-launcher/releases) (only get the TIPA file if you want to use the jailbreak tweak)
- Jailbreak tweak (optional, you need to be jailbroken)

## Installing TrollStore
Check the table from https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/ to install TrollStore depending on your iOS version and your device's chipset (you can find it by searching "iPhone/iPad (your phone/tablet's model) chipset")

## Installing Geode through TrollStore
Tap the `+` button and tap either **Install IPA File** or **Install From URL**, depending if you manually downloaded the IPA or the TIPA file. After either selecting the IPA or the TIPA file for the Geode app, or providing the URL, the Geode app should appear on your home screen!

## Installing the Jailbreak Tweak (optional)

> [!WARNING]
> Only follow this if you're jailbroken and have the TIPA version installed!

> [!WARNING]
> If you follow this and your jailbreak goes away (whether from a reboot, battery dying and etc.), Geode will not work. You will have to re-jailbreak your device for Geode to work again.

> [!TIP]
> Once you install the jailbreak tweak, you can launch the game without going to the Geode launcher. However you should keep the launcher if you want to restart the game, enter safe mode and update Geode!

When you **install the TIPA version**, Geode **will ask you to add the repository for the jailbreak tweak**. Choose the package manager you use and add the repository.

Then **go to the Geode repository and install the Geode Inject tweak**. After you install the tweak, **restart SpringBoard**.

Then **go to the Geode launcher, download Geode** and simply launch the game!

## Conclusion
You should now be able to run Geometry Dash with Geode! You can install mods by tapping the **Geode** button on the bottom of the menu, and browse for mods to install!
